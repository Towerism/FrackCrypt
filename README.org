** Requirements
- Biicode
- CMake 3.x
** Instructions
First you need to initialize biicode with:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ bii init -L
#+END_SRC
Then the following commands can get you started:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ bii build
$ bii test
#+END_SRC
If you introduce new dependencies, you need to let biicode look for them with:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ bii find
#+END_SRC
See the Biicode website on how to properly include external dependencies, as well
as the dependencies available on Biicode.
